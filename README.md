Introducing an innovative Hydroponic System integrating cutting-edge technology with AI-enabled growth monitoring and disease detection, designed for vertical cultivation using h1 hybrid seeds. This system incorporates a NodeMCU microcontroller, soil moisture sensor, DHT22 for environmental monitoring, relay, submersible pump, and pH sensor. Harnessing the power of AI for disease detection through image analysis, it ensures early identification of issues to prevent crop damage. By monitoring soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, the system optimizes watering schedules and adjusts pH levels for precise nutrient uptake, revolutionizing traditional farming practices. Its applications span across Smart Agriculture, enabling farmers to optimize resource utilization and enhance crop yield, to Urban Farming, facilitating efficient vertical cultivation in limited spaces, and to Data-Driven Agriculture, contributing to higher resource efficiency through precision cultivation techniques.
