# Hydroponic-System
Description
An integrated hydroponics system with AI-enabled growth monitoring, disease detection, and optimized lighting, catering to vertical cultivation using h1 hybrid seeds and sensors for precise nutrient and pH control, offering advanced disease identification and future growth projection for enhanced crop management.
Working
The Hydroponic system utilizes advanced technology to optimize water usage and ensure crop health. It incorporates a NodeMCU microcontroller, soil moisture sensor, DHT22 for environmental monitoring, relay, submersible pump, and pH sensor. Additionally, AI is employed for disease detection through image analysis. The system monitors soil moisture, temperature, and humidity to determine watering needs, adjusts pH levels for optimal nutrient uptake, and detects diseases early to prevent crop damage. Overall, it revolutionizes traditional farming practices by promoting efficient water usage, monitoring environmental conditions, and enhancing crop health through advanced technology.
Application
•	Smart Agriculture: Revolutionizes traditional farming methods by providing precise growth monitoring and disease detection, enabling farmers to optimize resource utilization, reduce chemical usage, and enhance crop yield.
•	Urban Farming: Fits well in urban environments where space is limited, enabling efficient vertical cultivation and promoting local food production, contributing to food security in cities.
•	Data-Driven Agriculture: Contributes to the implementation of precision agriculture techniques by collecting, analyzing, and utilizing data to optimize cultivation practices, resulting in higher resource efficiency.
